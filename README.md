## Yelp Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview
In this project, I will employ natural language processing techniques to analyze customer sentiments expressed in Yelp's restaurants reviews. The primary goal is to perform sentiment analysis to determine the mood and emotions of customers, and then create a regression model to predict the number of stars a customer is likely to give a restaurant. By identifying and analyzing key features of this model, the project aims to help restaurants understand which keywords significantly impact customer ratings. This analysis will provide actionable insights that enable restaurants to gain a deeper understanding of their business and implement strategies for improvement.
