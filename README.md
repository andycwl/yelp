## Yelp Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview
In this project, I will employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer sentiments expressed in Yelp's restaurants reviews. The primary goal is to perform sentiment analysis to determine the mood and emotions of customers, and then create a regression model to predict the number of stars a customer is likely to give a restaurant. By identifying and analyzing key features of this model, the project aims to help restaurants understand which keywords significantly impact customer ratings. This analysis will provide actionable insights that enable restaurants to gain a deeper understanding of their business and implement strategies for improvement.

### Dataset Overview
This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data modeling on the Yelp dataset. Here are the key details about the five json files within the Yelp dataset tar file:

- Reviews: Contains 6,990,280 reviews from users.
- Businesses: Provides information on 150,346 businesses.
- Pictures: Includes a collection of 200,100 pictures.
- Metropolitan Areas: Covers data from 11 metropolitan areas.
- Tips: Features over 908,915 tips from 1,987,897 users.

### Data Source
Yelp Dataset: The primary datasets used for this analysis are the 'Reviews', 'Businesses', 'Metropolitan Areas', and 'Tips' datasets. These data contains detailed information about each restaurant's business information, each user reviews' detail, and each user's information.

### Tools
- Python Jupyter Notebook - Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), NLP Modeling, and Regression Modeling

### Step 1: Data Preparation
During the initial data preparation phase, I extracted the Yelp data from the downloaded tar file and converted them into dataframes for further analysis. In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Checking for missing values
- Data Cleaning and Formatting
